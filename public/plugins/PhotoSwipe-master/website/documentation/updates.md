It's very important to keep PhotoSwipe updated, especially during the beta period.

Each time PhotoSwipe gets an update - [GitHub releases](https://github.com/dimsemenov/PhotoSwipe/releases) page is updated with details about release. 
Releases page has an [Atom feed](https://github.com/dimsemenov/PhotoSwipe/releases.atom), you may setup email notifications when feed is updated [using IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/recipes/230902-photoswipe-update-notification):

<div>
	<a href="https://ifttt.com/view_embed_recipe/230902-photoswipe-update-notification" target = "_blank" class="embed_recipe embed_recipe-l_30" id= "embed_recipe-230902"><img src= 'https://ifttt.com/recipe_embed_img/230902' alt="IFTTT Recipe: PhotoSwipe update notification connects feed to email" width="370px" style="max-width:100%"/></a><script async type="text/javascript" src= "//ifttt.com/assets/embed_recipe.js"></script>
</div>
