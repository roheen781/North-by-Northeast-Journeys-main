###### ACCOMMODATION AND MEALS ON THIS TOUR

Accomodation will be mostly done in small family run lodges which offer all the basic luxuries during the approach and end of the trekking phase, during the trek itself it will be total camping in dome tents. The accomodations are small, clean and give you the real local flavour. However this tour does offer options of more luxurious accomodation. As far as possible we would prefer local fare when it comes to meals, however we understand the need for comfort food when multiple days of intense exertion is required. Nutritious and palatable foot is always freshly cooked with fresh local ingredients. We provide potable packaged water which we carry in large 20lt cans so as keep plastic to the minimum. Reusable water bottles are provided at the onset of each journey.
