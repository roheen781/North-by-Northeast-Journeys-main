## Safe Travel options in Northeast India during Covid 19

We have come up with this series with the Covid 19 pandemic in mind. Lot of thought has gone into producing these itineraries, looking at the safety of our clients but more so to ensure the safety of locals of this region. We have come to the conclusion that to ensure the saftey of all parties involved it is best we have no cultural angle to these tours. We will leave the interactive bits for a post Covid world. For now we offer journeys of seclusion, nature and adventure.
