#### Multi-activty tour of Eastern Arunachal Pradesh: Cycle, Hike, Raft and nature in India's far east.

---
This multi-activity tour takes us to eastern Arunachal Pradesh. This is where the major tributaries of the Brahmaputra River come together and hence the Brahmaputra valley is born. Surrounded by the Himalayas and the Patkai Range on three sides and Brahmaputra valley on the other, this region is the home of numerous tribal cultures. Each one of these tribes are unique in their language, food, textile pattern, headgear, machetes etc, and yet so distinct with strong Mongoloid features, tight knit societies and their nonchalant ease in and around the forests. 

Starting from the rich valley of the Lohit we will move towards that of the Dibang River, cycling through villages of various tribes, hiking in the Mehao Wildlife Sanctuary and rafting on the mighty Dibang River while absorbing the uniqueness of the region and its abuntant nature.
