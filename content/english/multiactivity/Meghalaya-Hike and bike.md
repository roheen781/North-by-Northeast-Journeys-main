###### Acommodation and Meals on this tour

Although as much as possible we would prefer local family run establishments as opposed to mega chains run by people who already have a lot, on certain days of this tour there are options of fairly luxurious acommodations. As far as possible we would prefer local fare when it comes to meals, however we understand the need for comfort food when multiple days of intense exertion is required. Nutritious and palatable foot is always freshly cooked with fresh local ingredients. We provide potable packaged water which we carry in large 20lt cans so as keep plastic to the minimum. Reusable water bottles are provided at the onset of each journey. 

``` ** Our Itineraries are quite unique hence we prefer not to put it up on the site. Please write in to us for the detailed itinerary and cost.```
