###### Acommodation and Meals on this tour

Accomodation will be mostly done in small family run lodges which offer all the basic luxuries. They are small, clean and give you the local flavour. There are a couple of days of camping in picturesque locations. As far as possible we would prefer local fare when it comes to meals, however we understand the need for comfort food when multiple days of intense exertion is required. Nutritious and palatable foot is always freshly cooked with fresh local ingredients. We provide potable packaged water which we carry in large 20lt cans so as keep plastic to the minimum. Reusable water bottles are provided at the onset of each journey.
