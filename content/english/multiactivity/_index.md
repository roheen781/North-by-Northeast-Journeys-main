## Multi-Activity holidays across Northeastern India

We offer a combination of activities ranging from trekking, cycling, wildlife, kayaking, rafting and culture. These Multiactivity tours in Northeast India provide an opportunity to soak in this beautiful part of the world through different means. From the saddle of a cycle to an elephants back, a lonely lake on bamboo rafts to some of the deepest caves. River dolphins from country boats to fishing in a glacial fed river while staying in family run homestays. Eco lodges, tea estate bungalows and safari lodges, all these experiences can be had in the same holiday. The given multi-activity tour packages of northeast India can be further modified to suit your taste and requirements.
