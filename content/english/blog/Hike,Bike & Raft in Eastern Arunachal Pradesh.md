This tour takes us to Upper Assam and eastern Arunachal Pradesh in fact to the easternmost region of India. This is where the major tributaries of the Brahmaputra River come together and hence the Brahmaputra valley is born. Surrounded by the Himalayas and the Patkai Range on three sides and Brahmaputra valley on the other, this region is the home of numerous tribal cultures. Each one of these tribes are unique in their language, food, textile pattern, headgear, machetes etc, but yet so distinct with strong Mongoloid features, tight knit society and their nonchalant ease in and around the forests. Here we will Cycle about 200 km, Hike in the Kamlang Wildlife Sanctuary and Raft on the mighty Dibang River.
