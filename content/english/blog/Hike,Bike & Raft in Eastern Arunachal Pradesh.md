This multi-activity tour of eastern Arunachal Pradesh takes us on bicycles, rafts and on foot across the watershed area of the Brahmaputra River valley. This region situated at the foothills of the Mishmi hills is the land of the Animist and Theravada Buddhist tribes.

Authentic interactions, local cuisine, history and lifestyle of the tribes etc are our focus here. The cycling phase takes us across territories of six different tribes where as the hiking phase takes us away from civilization into theKamlang and Namdapha Wildlife Sanctuaries. This multi-activity tour of Eastern Arunachal Pradesh also includes rafting on the Dibang and the Lohit rivers.
