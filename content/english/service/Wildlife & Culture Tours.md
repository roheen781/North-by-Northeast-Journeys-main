These 8 states lying in the Indo-Burmese and the Himalayan Bio-diversity hotspots are also home to over 150 unique and distinct ethinic groups. 
The close proximity of the High Himalayas to the coast has created a compact stretch of land with a multitude of vegetation. If we take a closer look, we see that the Ecology of the region varies from Alpine Tundra in the northern regions to Tropical and Sub tropical Rainforests in the lower areas. The central river valleys support Grasslands and large wetland areas.This variety in Eco-systems has created a heaven for bio-diversity. This region also boasts of the highest density of protected Wildlife Reserves in the country.

Perhaps the same reason that makes this region so rich in its natural diversity also makes it the most Ethnic, Linguistic and Cultural diverse region in the Indian sub-continent. These eight states in themselves constitute a single linguistic region with about 220 languages in three different language groups (Indo-Aryan, Sino-Tibetan and Austric). These tribes provide a cultural bridge between India and south East Asia, China, Inner Asia and Burma by ethnic and linguistic angles, as most of these tribes migrated here from the North and the East over the centuries.
