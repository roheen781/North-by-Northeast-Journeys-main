## Family getaways in Northeastern India

Active Adventures for the whole family. Our Family Activity holidays of northeast India have much to offer. From the saddle of a cycle to an elephants back, a lonely lake on bamboo rafts to some of the deepest caves, river dolphins from country boats  while staying in family run homestays, eco lodges, tea estate bungalows and safari lodges, all these experiences can be had in the same holiday. We have broadly divided these tours between **Comfort** and **Off the grid** looking at the availability of variety in accomodation.

The given packages are a few examples, these  can be further modified to suit your taste and requirements or we can just start a new itinerary right from scratch.
