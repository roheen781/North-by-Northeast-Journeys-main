The setting of this ride of Arunachal Pradesh is in the Buddhist belt home to the Monpa and Sherdukpen people. Close to the border with Bhutan and Tibet, this is one of the highest motorable routes of the eastern Himalayas, at places taking you to an altitude of 4200mts. The road condition though not at the best is still better than most parts of Arunachal Pradesh. The cycling phase covers between 300 to 650Kms, riding on little used roads of western Arunachal Pradesh.
