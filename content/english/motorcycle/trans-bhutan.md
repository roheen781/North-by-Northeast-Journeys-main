### Gross national happiness experienced

This trans-Bhutan motorcycle tour starts and ends in the Brahmaputra Valley of Assam. This route takes you across the Kingdom of Bhutan for the west to its east. 

Riding out of the Brahmaputra plains we enter Bhutan through its main western gateway at Phuentsholing. Riding from its westernmost valleys to its far east, every day is a revelation. On this odyssey of the happy kingdom, we explore its Dzongs, Monasteries, sub alpine villages, national parks and more. From the beginning to the finish, a plethora of terrain to be negotiated, warm and gentle people to be met and scrumptious cuisines to be indulged in. This motorcycle tour of Bhutan is much more than just about riding.
