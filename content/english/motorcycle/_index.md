## Motorcycle & Overland tours across Northeastern India

Our Motorcycle and Overland tours take you off the main highways and into the backroads of Northeast India. We are not held hostage by hotels, well tarred roads and such minutes. With our mobile camping unit, homestays and a very able team of locals we take you deeper into the real East. These tours are fully supported with knowledgeable guides, mechanic and back up vehicles. However, our routes do require a good amount of experience on the riders / drivers side. Given the varied geography, road conditions and weather conditions these routes can not exactly be called easy. If you are looking for a experience of a lifetime, look no further!

Itineraries highlighted below are just a few of our publicized routes, given our knowledge of the region we can customize a tour from scratch to fit the bill, be it duration, techinical level, comfort level etc.
