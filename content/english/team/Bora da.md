bio : Call him the 'Doctor', call him the 'Chief Engineer'. Bora da is an integral part of our motorcycle tours, he is the one who keeps the machines going day after day. In the  moring he is the first one up, checking all the bikes, ensuring the day goes without any mechanical issues. Come a puncture and he handles it in a jiffy, at the end of the days riding he is always there to ask if any bike has anny issues, if so he goes about ensuring that by the next morning it is rectified. In his younger days he used to race bikes, even now he handles a Royal Enfield bullet like the master that he is.
