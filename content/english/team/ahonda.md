bio : Young Ahonda took up cycling by chance on one of our tours where he was helping the camping team. In the the four years that followed he already became one of the top 5 MTB riders of the country with an impressive list of wins under in his belt. Ahonda is a unending bank of energy. One will find him leading our cycling groups, typically covering double the day distance riding up and down seeing to the groups safety.
