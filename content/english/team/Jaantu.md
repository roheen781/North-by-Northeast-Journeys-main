bio : For over 20 years now Janntu has been driving tourists across the region, right since the inception of tourism in this region. He can put Google maps to shame. He is a walking talking bank of knowledge and connections, one can take him anywhere in the northeast and he will have local contacts, know all the alternate routes and have knowledge of everything that is locally special. When it comes to driving, one cant be in safer hands.
