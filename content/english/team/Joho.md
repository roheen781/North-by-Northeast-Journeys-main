bio : Coming from Anini lying in the remotest corner of this country Joho is a force of nature. Many a client will tell you that when joho walks in the forests not a leaf moves. His undestanding of his surroundings, his ability to make things seemingly out of nothing , his hawk eyes that can follow tracks in the wildest of setting, yes one can spend a whole tour just observing and being amazed by this wonderful soul.
