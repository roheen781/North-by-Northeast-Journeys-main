bio : Since the age of '8' KD has been helping run his home. By the time he reached the age of 25 he has already worked as a vegetable grocer, a police jeep driver, a stone mason, a welder, a carpenter and now as a guide among other things. Kd, even though quite young is a bank of real world knowledge and experience. One would typically see him always on his feet doing something or the other, he is not one to sit idle. Being from the Khasi tribe of Meghalaya, he does bring in a lot of depth to our Meghalaya trips in particular, however you would come across him in most of our tours across the region playing some part or the other.
