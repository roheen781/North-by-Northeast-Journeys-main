bio : When not writing Haiku, Manjit aka 'Batmanjit' is an integral spoke in the north by northeast wheel. Effortlessly wearing many hats, from leading a motorcycle tour, to handling a trekking group to giving much needed backup on a cycle tour. He is not all muscle, Manjit adds to the overall prospective and understanding of the region as well as life in general with his deep insights, knowledge and wonderful sense of humour.
