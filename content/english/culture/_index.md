## Cultural Immersions and Wildlife escapades across Northeastern India
 
---

Sometimes the Seven Sisters of the Northeast (the states of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland and Tripura) hardly seem like India at all. The region’s hundreds of tribes and subtribes are slowly embracing modernity, but remain extremely diverse. Nagaland’s former headhunters now go to church on Sundays. Many Arunachalis also attend church-like buildings on Sundays – to worship the sun and moon. Cloudy Himalayan valleys near the border of Tibet are dotted with colourful monasteries, echoing with Buddhist chants and clashing cymbals. These eight states in themselves constitute a single linguistic region with about 220 languages in three different language groups (Indo-Aryan, Sino-Tibetan and Austric). The tribes provide a cultural bridge between India and south East Asia, China, Inner Asia and Burma by ethnic and linguistic angles, as most of these tribes migrated here from the North and the East over the centuries.


The North Eastern region of the India  is home to one of the richest biodiversity of the Indian subcontinent. This region has a predominantly humid sub-tropical climate with hot, humid summers, severe monsoons and fairly mild winters. Along with the west coast of India, it has some of the Indian sub-continent’s last remaining rain forests which support’s diverse flora and fauna and several endemic species. It has been pooled under the Eastern Himalayan and the Indo-Burmese Biodiversity hot spots. The close proximity of the High Himalayas to the coast has created a compact stretch of land with a multitude of vegetation. If we take a closer look, we see that the Ecology of the region varies from Alpine Tundra in the northern regions to Tropical and Sub tropical Rainforests in the lower areas. The central river valleys support Grasslands and large wetland areas.This variety in Eco-systems has created a heaven for bio-diversity, hence naturally it boasts of the highest density of protected Wildlife Reserves in the country. Kaziranga, Manas, Nameri and Namdapha National Parks are some of the better known ones.
