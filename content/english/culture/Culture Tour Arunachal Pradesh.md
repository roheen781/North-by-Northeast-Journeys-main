### A cultural odyssey across Arunachal Pradesh.

The origins of the tribes that are currently living in Arunachal Pradesh remain shrouded in mystery. Whatever little is known has been passed down from generation to generation via oral traditions. It is widely believed that the tribes who inhabit this land now, came from Burma (present day Myanmar) and Tibet, where Mongoloid tribal groups with similar cultures still live.

Over the course of these migrations, several inter-tribal feuds occurred, which resulted in the groups scattering across the region. In addition to that, natural calamities that had occurred in the area forced the tribes to take up different habitats and adapt to the nature of their geophysical surroundings.

When you’re in Arunachal Pradesh, you will hear of stories about inter-tribal warfare, when tribes battled for supremacy and better lands. Although you can’t see any fences, most of the tribal territories of Arunachal Pradesh are invisibly marked. Every tribe knows its territories and the rivers that come under them and which particular clan alone has hunting or fishing rights over that area. In order to maintain a distinct identity, each tribe used tattoos, headgears or nose plugs.

On this cultural journey of Arunachal Pradesh, we travel across territories of 13 unique tribes.
